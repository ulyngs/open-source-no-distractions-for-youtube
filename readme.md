# Important: I am deprecating this app in favour of the general solution 'MindShield'
*MindShield* includes everything "No Distractions" for YouTube does, but it works on ANY website. As I am really pressured for time, I will be sunsetting "No Distractions" for YouTube and only update MindShield going forward.

MindShield's is on the App Store here: https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/mindshield/id1660218371

And its source code is here: https://github.com/ulyngs/mindshield-open-source
